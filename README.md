# oakgrove
Placeholder for [oak](https://github.com/oakmoundstudio/oak) examples that may have dependencies/assets that would bloat the oak package.

# contributing 
See contributing.md for specifics but pretty much all contributions are welcomed happily.

# licensing
To illustrate what can be done in oak in a positive light this repository includes art for the examples.
To be able to use certain art it was placed under [a different path](assets/) with a corresponding slightly less permissive license.
